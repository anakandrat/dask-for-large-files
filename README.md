# Dask for large files

Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing 
in Python. In this example I used dask dataframe 
to store data from large files and execute merge 
(inner join) operation.

## Setup
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

Add files to ```data/ ``` and configure in the script.

```
$ python main.py
```
